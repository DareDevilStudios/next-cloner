        desc2="Our in-house team of naval architects and hydrodynamics engineers are competent in assisting clients for engineering solutions to complete project on schedule and on budget. Resistance and propulsion calculations are done primarily during the new-build designs. Multi body stimulations involves interactions of more than one vessel or platforms with each other for offshore activities. We perform sloshing analysis to determine dynamic pressures generated in tanks due to vessel motions."
